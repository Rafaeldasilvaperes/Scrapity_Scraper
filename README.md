# Scrapity Scraper!

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## What's been done so far:

<p align="justify">Here I've created a script on Python to basically keep digging the price of two items from one website 4 times a day and keep checking if the price is above the value I setted as the "Dream Price", and when it's not it will send me an e-mail warning that I can now tell someone whose wallet is fuller than mine to buy these products right away!</p>

## What will be done next:

<p align="justify">I intend to create a database that will store important informations like date/time/price and build a simple web page that keeps updating and showing this online. Will probably be deployed on Heroku.</p>
